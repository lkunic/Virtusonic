# Fixes

## Blender

/////// TODO ///////
Update pick animations
- Increase the footprint of the picking animation so that the pull motion more obviously affects the string.
- Change the resting positions so that they are closer to the strings, in order to give more time for the pick animation (maybe reduce the frame count for the pick animation to allow faster picking).

Update the pick and fret finger models
- Modify the geometry to add more detail and allow prettier texturing.
////////////////////


## Unreal
/////// TODO /////// 
Implement string press material change
- Create a string material with parametrized texture size and create a dynamic material instance for the string sections.
- Implement dynamic material parameter change so that the textures always seem the same size, regardless of the current fret shape key.

Import the new pick animations
- Import the updated pick animations and synchronise them with string vibrations, so that the strings begin moving as the picks touch them.

Import the improved pick and fret finger models
- Import the models and create new materials for them

Record and add new sounds to the strings
- For each string, record the 12th fret note.
- Import the new recordings and replace the old placeholder sound.

Fingering algorithm fixes
- Implement postprocessing in order to remove unnecessary finger movement. Tweak the parameters to achieve more visually pleasing finger movement.

Return to startup menu once the song finishes playing
- Fade out from the current level and return to the menu

# New Features

Loading screen
- Between the startup menu and playing the song. Use to load the environment level, setup the instruments, load the song and calculate all the required actions.
- The final level is loaded when everything is ready.
- Smooth blending from the startup menu when starting the loading, and fade out/in or blend when starting the environment level.
- Show progress? Or spinning loading animation in the corner while playing a simple cinematic?

Startup menu improvements
- Background cinematic with the menu as overlay.

Dynamic camera
- Multiple cameras that switch with the music and smoothly follow what is being played.
- Can be turned off during playtime, enabling free camera movement.
- Intro fly-in movement when loading a song.
- When multiple instruments are added, modify so that the camera follows all the instruments at the most interesting times (when an instrument first starts playing, when it plays more notes than others at a certain time).

Multiple environments
- Concert hall. Improve lighting by reducing the number of lights and replacing them with lower-cost emissive surfaces (model in Blender, apply as material). Increase the brightness at the stage and decrease the audience visibility + decrease the chair model complexity to improve performance.
- Outdoor scene at day or nighttime (cool reflections, skydomes).
- Play with camera focal points and blur in order to get better visual look of the environment with reduced model complexity, allowing the instruments to be more detailed and realistic.
- Different lighting setups.

New songs
- Try to come up with songs which contain notes on the entire neck, in order to demonstrate the fingering algorithm and animations.
- Transcriptions for bass sections of popular songs.
- Songs with chords.
- Multi-instrument songs.

New string instruments
- Guitar, ukulele
- Different models of the same instruments (electric vs acoustic guitar, popular shapes and models).

Fancy note styles
- Slides.
- Chord strumming.

Note visualization
- Create a scrolling note sheet (tablature? note names?) which progresses as the song is played and displays upcoming notes. 
- Can also have a nice animation when a note is played.

New instrument types
- Keyboard (piano, synth)
